# Smart Mobility Project

This repository contains our prototype for a **Smart Mobility Platform** that connects city administrations and drivers to improve parking, traffic flow, and safety through data-driven insights and IoT integration.

## Collaboration Rules

To keep our workflow clean and consistent:

1. **Do not push directly to `main`.**  
   - Always create your own branch for changes.  
   - Use the format:  
     `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`  
     Example: `feature/rewards-system`

2. **When your work is ready, create a Merge Request (Pull Request)**  
   - At least one teammate should review before merging into `dev` or more important `main`.

3. **Write meaningful commit messages.**  
   - Describe briefly what you changed or added.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     feat: add parking recommendation logic
     fix: resolve map z-index issue
     ```

4. **Keep commits small and clear.**  
   Avoid huge “everything at once” commits.

5. **Use English** for all commit messages, variable names, and comments.
